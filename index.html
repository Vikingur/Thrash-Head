<h2>Medical Gear Solid</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Sneak into a hospital, and extract a vital organ from a key patient, set to become the prototype for the next generation of augmented supersoldiers.
</li>

<li><strong>Controls:</strong>
<p>
Move around the map with the arrow keys.
Interact with Spacebar.
Don't get seen!
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Feeling stealthy and feeling pressure from all around.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Stealth game
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Sneak around Our Lady of Shadow Moses Hospital and dodge the watchful eyes of Dr. Liquid and his GENOME interns.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Make an avoidance stealth game with some light exploration and puzzle solving. Try using the phone at the desk!
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The surgery wing of Our Lady of Shadow Moses Hospital, recently acquired by head surgeon, Dr. Liquid.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
I can't make sense of it myself, but there's probably nanomachines in the patient's kidney that are important for something...
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Sneaky, thoughtful, cerebral types.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Around 5 minutes.
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keep track of where guards are patrolling and looking.
Try to find ways to distract people.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Thrown together in Piskel. "EasyStar" pathfinding forked on Github, somewhat edited and patched in by me.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Okay, I misunderstood this question the last few prototypes. I thought it was asking for which of
the Phaser examples it had been drawn from.
It's pretty clearly an MSX Metal Gear clone. Top-down sneaking action.
