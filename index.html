<h2>Thrash Head V2</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Irritable metalhead wants to enjoy his evening free of nuisance.
</li>

<li><strong>Controls:</strong>
<p>
Move around the pit with the arrow keys.
Headbang with the space bar.
Doing it in time with the music and lights increases your attack power.

<h4>New features!</h4>
Keep an eye on the rest of the crowd. If you piss them off too much you'll get thrown out!
Enjoy the new "Wimp" difficulty mode that adds a convenient clicktrack if you can't even follow the lights.
Marvel at minor bug fixes like not getting trapped against walls anymore!
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want to make a game that makes a person headbang while they play it, without a detriment to performance.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Rhythm game, fighting game
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Give a drunken lout the business when he starts throwing karate kicks and punches in the mosh pit.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Make a serviceable rhythm game structure, with servicable animation and serviceable changing backgrounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Extreme Aggression, an Exhibition Bout, getting Caught in a Mosh, learning a Lesson in Violence.

Future additions would include further fighting game mechanics, like blocking and combos, as well as multiple enemy types and missions.
Instead of constant combat, gameplay could expand to other rhythmic challenges, like trying to stay upright while crowdsurfing for as long
as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Every concert I've ever been to with a local metalcore opener where some tough guys try to treat the pit like a dojo.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Only the story of a down-on-his-luck thrasher with everything to lose.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Just true metal people, that's Thrash Head's crowd.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
At least a minute if you want to hear all the chugs and riffs before you win.
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Watch your health and know when to back off, try to keep the rhythm of the fight going.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I repurposed a Bolt Thrower song, shortening it significantly. I had planned to write and record my own, but wouldn't
you know it, my audio interface burnt out on me. That and I don't actually know how to use drum software...</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Okay, I think I misunderstood the question the last few times. This is most similar to Guitar Hero style rhythm games and retro game style beat-em-ups like Kung Fu.
